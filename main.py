"""A Pokemon Game built for Python Workshop, Locus 2016.

The game is simple and text-based. Pokemons data are read
from file. User get to choose a pokemon while the computer
chooses one at random. Then the battle starts with the user
and the computer alternatively choosing attacks for their
respective pokemons. The game ends when one of the pokemon
loses all health.
